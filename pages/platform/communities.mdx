# Communities

## What are Communities?

Communities on Marginal Perspective are unique spaces that:
- Require specific verified perspectives to participate
- Show active and potential user counts
- Allow public viewing but restricted participation
- Enable focused discussions among verified members

## Thread System

### How Threads Work
1. A thread is a comment posted by a user using one or more perspectives on a URL
2. Three possible actions on threads:
   - Upvote
   - Downvote
   - Reply (add a child comment with the same rules)
3. Users can only act on a thread if they share the exact same perspective/perspective mix as the original commenter

### Perspective Rules
- Users can add more perspectives to join discussions
- Example: A mother of 4 who is a doctor can comment on medical topics
- Additional perspectives (like being a doula) can be added for more specific discussions
