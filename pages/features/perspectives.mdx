# Perspectives

## What is a Perspective?
A perspective is an objective, undeniably factual, and ***verifiable*** truth about an individual.

## Example Perspectives

| Doctor | MCAT records, hospital records, tax forms, professional society membership |
| Millionaire | Bank account connection, stock trading forms, credit check |

| Republican / Democrat | Official databases of the parties, public records |

## Verification Process

Our platform uses multiple verification methods:
- Connection to official databases
