# What is Marginal Perspective?

Marginal Perspective is an internet platform that makes it easy to trust the different truths you hear online. Our platform anonymizes and hides everything about the identity of the poster, **except for the verified perspective or perspectives they chose to comment with**.

## Core Concept

Information on the internet is accessed via URLs - *universal* resource locators. Our platform:
- Verifies the data you provide about yourself and your experiences
- Allows you to comment on all or part of any URL
- Enables others who share your perspective to agree (upvote), disagree (downvote), or reply
- Strips away extraneous elements in online communication
- Facilitates immediate communication of only the necessary information

## Why Choose Marginal Perspective?

We are a matchmaking platform connecting two groups:
1. Those who want to tell their truth
2. Those who want to listen to a truth

The truths exchanged are the essence of the platform, and our product is the feeling of having any verified truth you want at your fingertips.
